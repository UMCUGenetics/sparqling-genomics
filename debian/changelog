sparqling-genomics (0.99.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release brings a large amount of changes (or dare we say "improvements").
  The most important changes:

  * The introduction of the sg-auth-manager, a SPARQL parser, and a mechanism
    to build RDF store clusters by using the sg-web authentication mechanism.
  * Revised triplet output. We use MD5 hashing instead of SHA256, and we
    removed the "sparqling-genomics" (domain) name from various RDF elements.
  * Small but many web interface improvements.
  * Reduced dependency footprint. GNU Guile uses gnutls, so we removed
    libgcrypt in favor of gnutls in the command-line tools.
