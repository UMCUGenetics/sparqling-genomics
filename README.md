# SPARQLing genomics

**NOTE:** The project's development continues at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/roelj/sparqling-genomics).

SPARQLing genomics is a combination of tools and practices to create an
integrated knowledge graph to make **discovering**, **connecting**, and
**collaborating** easy.

For installation, usage, and more information, please see the [documentation (PDF)](https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/sparqling-genomics/blob/master/doc/sparqling-genomics.pdf).
