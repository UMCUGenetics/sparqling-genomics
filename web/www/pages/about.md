## About genomics-db

### Goals of the database

This is the web interface to a database designed for the following
targets:

* “Blacklist” filtering of structural variants based on position and number of
  occurrences;
* Cherry-picking of datasets to query on;
* Integrate with other ontology-based graph databases;

### Goals of the web interface

The web interface itself intends to:

* Provide a demo page for simple interactions with the database;
* Provide an overview of what kind of data can be found in the database;
* Provide documentation for using this database in your programs and scripts.

### State of the project

As you may have noticed, all features are missing.  Currently, the tooling to
import data into the database is being developed.  If you would like to receive
a notification for when there's something useful here,
