## Ontologies

### Close-to-home

Probably the easiest ontology to start using is the “close-to-home” ontology.
This is the first ontology developed to provide a filtering database built
with a triple store.

* [close-to-home.ttl](#) (Turtle);
* [close-to-home.xml](#) (RDF/XML).

#### EDAM

The “close-to-home” ontology tries to relate information to the concepts
described in the [EDAM ontology](http://edamontology.org).
