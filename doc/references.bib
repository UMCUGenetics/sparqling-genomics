abstract = {Abstract The human X and Y chromosomes have quite different deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and gene contents, and appear completely cytologically nonhomologous. However, they share many homologous regions, the relics of a process of gradual evolution from a homologous autosomal pair into the differentiated sex chromosome pair they are today.}
